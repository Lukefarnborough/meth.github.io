<center><h2>Agile Methods</h2></center>
<p>
Key terms
<br>
<ul>
<li>Early and continuous delivery</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li>self-organizing teams</li>
<li>Sustainable development</li>
<li>co-location</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<br>
The Agile Model starts with:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.</li>
<li>Working software is delivered frequently.</li>
<li>Close, daily cooperation between business people and deveopers.</li>
<li>Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.</li>
<li>Face-to-face conversations is the best form of communication (co-location)</li>
<li>Working software is the principal measure of progress.</li>
<li>Sustainable development ie sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.</li>
<li>Ssimplicity-The art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>Teams regularly reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it's behavior accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<center><h2>Agile Extreme Programming (XP)</h2></center>
Key terms
<br>
<ul>
<li>Paired programming</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Sustainable development</li>
<li>Daily stand up meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>XP Model</h3>
<br>
The Extreme Programming model starts with:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Small releases</li>
<li>Project is divided into iterations</li>
<li>Stand up meeting starts each day</li>
<li>Refactor whenever and wherever possible</li>
<li>Customer is always available</li>
<li>All production code is pair programmed</li>
<li>All code must have unit tests</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h3>The advantages of Extreme Programming</h3>
<p>
Quality of code should be very high
<br>
Testing is continuous
<br>
All programmers follow same rules
<br>
Sustainable pace-less chance of tired programmers!
<p>
<h3>The disadvantages of Extreme Programming</h3>
<p>
Programmers need to be based in same geographic location
<br>
Customer needs to provide a representative to work with team
<p>
<h3>When it might be used?</h3>
<p>
Early implementation is important
<br>
When requirements are changing
