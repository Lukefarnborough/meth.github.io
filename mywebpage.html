Sharing
<BR>
There are piracy laws protecting the distribution of films and other media. It is illegal to rip a copyrighted DVD or CD and distribute it online. However, peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks and hosting websites mean it is easy to share files with anyone in the world.

Hacking
<BR>
The term 'hacking' can have a positive or negative meaning. It refers to any activity which makes unusual use of, or attempts to break, a computer system. Hacking can be used for negative purposes such as looking for weaknesses in systems to access and steal private data, but it can also be used for positive purposes such as creatively exploring new ways of using a program or computer.
