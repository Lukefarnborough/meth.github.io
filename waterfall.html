<h3>Model</h3>
<br>
The waterfall Model starts with:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Determining the requirements-This is where documenting requirements gathered from questionnaires, observation and interviews. Acceptance tests are often paired with requirements.</li>
<li>Analysis-Feasibility TELOS is asked; T=technical such as is the technology available?,E=economical is it cost effective?,L=Legal is it upholing the laws? O=Operations such as how effective the project will be in solving the problem, S=schedule can it be done in time?.</li>
<li>Design-This includes data dictionary, data flow diagrams, flowcharts and structure diagrams.</li>
<li>Coding-This is where the coding is done for the project</li>
<li>Testing-White/black box, alpha/beta, performance tests, etc.</li>
<li>Maintenance-Corrective, perfective, adaptive maintenance this is done to keep the software product usable in the changing future enviroment.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The advantages of the Waterfall cycle</h3>
<p>
There is lots of documentation involved in the project
<br>
Easy to schedule and arrange tasks which helps keep track of the project
<br>
It's simple and easy to understand model
<p>
<h3>The disadvantages of the Waterfall cycle</h3>
<p>
Lots of documentation
<br>
If in testing the systems fails to meet requirements, either the requirements must be modified, or a substantial change in the design is required. “In effect the development process has returned to the origin and one can expect up to a lO0-percent overrun in schedule and/or costs” (p329, Royce, 1970).
<br>
Misunderstanding of requirements discovered too late means that there is more work to go back through and change.
<br>
Users not involved until testing
<br>
Cannot accommodate changing requirements when needed
<br>
No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
<br>
Efficient code is not prioritized
<p>
<h3>When might it be used?</h3>
<p>
Straight forward projects where requirements are known and understood at the beginning and don't change.
<br>
When there is no benefit to the customer of having parts of the system available early.
<br>
Short projects
