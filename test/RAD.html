<center><h2>RAD</h2></center>
Key terms
<br>
<ul>
<li>Prototypes</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<br>
The RAD model starts with:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Determining the requirements-This is where documenting requirements gathered from questionnaires, observation and interviews. Acceptance tests are often paired with requirements.</li>
<li>Build prototype-This is where a simpler design of the final product is made to show the customer what it should roughly look like or do.</li>
<li>Evaluate prototype with customer-This is where the customer says what they like about the prototype and what they want changed.</li>
<li><i>Is the prototype good enough?</i>-This is where the Yes or No loop point is placed.</li>
<li>If No to number 4 then it loops to improve the prototype and re-evaluate the prototype with the customer, then back to number 4</li>
<li>If Yes to number 4 then Prototype becomes the fnal product.</li>
<p>
<h3>The advantages of RAD</h3>
<p>
Helpful when requirements are unclear to the team.
<br>
Should result in excellent usability for the customer
<br>
Changing requirements can be accommodated.
<br>
Encourages customer feedback in the project to get the best product.
<p>
<h3>The disadvantages of RAD</h3>
<p>
Efficient code is not prioritised.
<br>
Demanding on customer’s time for feedback (the customer has to be accessible).
<p>
<h3>When it might be used?</h3>
<p>
RAD should be used only when a system can be modularized to be delivered in incremental manner.
<br>
When the customer is unsure of their requirements.
<p>
<center><h2>RAD Spiral Model</h2></center>
Key terms
<br>
<ul>
<li>Prototypes</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li>Risk-analysis</li>
<li>Four quadrants</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Spiral Model</h3>
<br>
The RAD Spiral model starts with:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Quadrant 1-Determine objectives, alternatives and constraints.</li>
<li>Quadrant 2-Evaluate alternatives, risks are identified and resolved. If risks are too hig, then the project may be stopped. A prototype is created.</li>
<li>Quadrant 3-The prototype is developed.</li>
<li>Quadrant 4-Planning takes place for the next phase.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>The advantages of the RAD Spiral Model</h3>
<p>
Ideal for risky and complex projects.
<br>
Changing requirements can be accommodated.
<br>
Users see the system early.
<p>
<h3>The disadvantages of the RAD Spiral Model</h3>
<p>
Management is more complex and so can lead to further costs.
<br>
Process is more complex
<br>
Good risk analysts are expensive
<br>
Efficient code is not prioritized
<p>
<h3>When might it be used?</h3>
<p>
Significant changes are expected in the product during the development cycle
<br>
Customer is not sure of their requirements which is usually the case.
<br>
When the risk is high
<br>
RAD should be used only when a system can be modularized to be delivered in incremental manner.
